# Rainfall-Prediction
Project Overview
Dataset Information
    The dataset used in this project contains information on rainfall of Quang Ngai rain station: data about time, rainfall. temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed to predict rainfall at specific time.
Data Features
    The dataset consists of 6 variables, including:
        1.time: Time measured (dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss)
        2.rain_fall: Amount of rain fall measured at certain time (mm)
        3.temp: Temperature measured at certain time (Â°C)
        4.humidity: Humidity measured at certain time (%)
        5.wind_direction: Wind direction (1=N, 2=NNE, 3=NE, 4=ENE, 5=E, 6=ESE, 7=SE, 8=SSE, 9=S, 10=SSW, 11=SW, 12=WSW, 13=W, 14=WNW, 15=NW, 16=NNW, 17=unknown, 18=unknown) 
        6.wind_speed: Wind speed (0=0m/s, 1=1m/s, 2=2m/s, 3=3m/s, 4=4m/s, 5=5m/s, 6=unknown)
